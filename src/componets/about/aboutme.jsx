        <p>
          I am a passionate and results-driven full-stack web developer with
          expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js,
          PostgreSQL, and MySQL. With a strong foundation in both front-end and
          back-end development, I specialize in building scalable,
          user-friendly, and efficient web applications. I thrive in
          problem-solving environments, where I can apply my technical skills to
          create impactful solutions. My ability to quickly adapt to new
          technologies and frameworks enables me to stay ahead in the
          fast-evolving tech industry. I have hands-on experience working on
          real-world projects, including a blog platform for Teach2Give, where I
          collaborated with teams and improved my code optimization and database
          management skills. Whether working independently or as part of a team,
          I am committed to delivering high-quality, maintainable, and
          innovative software solutions. Currently, I am part of the PLP
          February cohort, continuously refining my skills and expanding my
          knowledge. I am excited about opportunities that allow me to build,
          innovate, and contribute to impactful projectsâ€”especially in tech hubs
          like Konza Technopolis.
